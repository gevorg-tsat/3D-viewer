Implementation of a program to visualise 3D wireframe models

The program provide the ability to\+: Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only). Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes. Rotate the model by a given angle relative to its X, Y, Z axes. Scale the model by a given value.

The program allow customizing the type of projection (parallel and central) The program allow setting up the type (solid, dashed), color and thickness of the edges, display method (none, circle, square), color and size of the vertices The program allow choosing the background color Settings saved between program restarts

The program allow saving the captured (rendered) images as bmp and jpeg files. The program allow recording small screencasts by a special button -\/ the current custom affine transformation of the loaded object into gif-\/animation (640x480, 10fps, 5s)
